This is more of a track of my personal journey in the world of finance and trading so in the week one I built a basic object oriented programming concept in 10 minutes and on the second project I built a stock analyzer which basically takes ticker Name start date end date and plot the desired stock using matplotlib data is the base of quantitative analysis so this is technically my first project You can neglect the scratch project I built account.py lol So I created a marathon plan what I'll be doing every week it goes like.....
